# FormattedAutoNumberingForCustomEntity
CodeSnippet CSharp on How to create an alphanumeric string for use as a password or an Number for any entity. On many occasions you may need to create a unique password or identifier string. There are already methods out there to create random strings of a given or variable length. I have taken the concept and modified it to suit my own need. Basically I create an array of characters and an array of numbers (removing any that may be easy to confuse). I then pass a parameter to determine how long the string will be. Finally I use a combination of the char string and a string of numbers to create my desired length output string (consisting in this case of 3 Hard coded letters followed by "-" then 4 numbers, then "-" lastly followed by 6 alphanumeric values).You can adapt it to other languages or make it part of your existing C# Library.
